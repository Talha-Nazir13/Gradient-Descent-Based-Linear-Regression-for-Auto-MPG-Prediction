<h1>Gradient Descent-Based Linear Regression for Auto MPG Prediction</h1>

<p>This project implements linear regression using gradient descent to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) for automobiles. The model is trained on features such as horsepower, weight, and acceleration, and the goal is to understand how these factors impact fuel efficiency.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation of linear regression using gradient descent.</li>
  <li>Preprocessing and normalization of the Auto MPG dataset.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.</li>
  <li>Visualization of training progress and model performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The project uses the Auto MPG dataset, which includes information about various automobile features and their respective fuel efficiency (MPG). The dataset includes the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>cylinders</strong>: Number of cylinders in the engine.</li>
  <li><strong>displacement</strong>: Engine displacement in cubic inches.</li>
  <li><strong>horsepower</strong>: Engine horsepower.</li>
  <li><strong>weight</strong>: Weight of the car in pounds.</li>
  <li><strong>acceleration</strong>: Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (in seconds).</li>
  <li><strong>year</strong>: Model year of the car.</li>
  <li><strong>origin</strong>: Origin of the car (coded as categorical values).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>numpy</code></li>
  <li><code>pandas</code></li>
  <li><code>matplotlib</code></li>
  <li><code>scikit-learn</code> (for evaluation metrics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Install the dependencies using:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>This project implements linear regression using gradient descent. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the model parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and actual MPG values.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>The model is trained using the gradient descent algorithm, with the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function. The learning rate and the number of iterations can be adjusted to fine-tune the model’s performance.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The project evaluates the model's performance on the Auto MPG dataset using the R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess how well the model predicts fuel efficiency based on the given features.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>You can adjust the following aspects of the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning rate</strong>: Tune the learning rate for gradient descent to optimize the convergence of the algorithm.</li>
  <li><strong>Features</strong>: Add or remove features from the dataset to see their impact on the model's performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularization</strong>: Implement L1 or L2 regularization to reduce overfitting, if necessary.</li>
</ul>
